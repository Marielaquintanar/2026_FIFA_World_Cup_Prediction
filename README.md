# 2026 FIFA World Cup Prediction


## Project Description

The FIFA World Cup 2026 Winner Prediction project employs machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict who could be the winner of the 
upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026. The project is based on historical data from past World Cups, including player information, world cup wins, and more. 
Using these statistics, a linear regression model is trained in Python to determine which historical factors might influence team performance and, ultimately, 
the prediction of the winner of the 2026 World Cup.

### Key Features

- Utilization of linear regression to analyze historical data from past FIFA World Cups.
- Extraction of relevant features from teams and players.
- Training of a prediction model using Python, Pandas, and Numpy.
- Data visualization and result presentation using the Seaborn library.
- Prediction of the potential winner of the 2026 FIFA World Cup based on historical statistics.
